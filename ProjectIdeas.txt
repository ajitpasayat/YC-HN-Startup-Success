Project Ideas:
- Pipe data onto front-end using Flask/Python.
- Four buttons representing different YC sessions (S14, W14, S13, W13) instead of input form.
- Include logos in the front-end somehow.
- Illuminate prediction and probabilty. Try bolding/coloring.
- Contemplate adding a separate chart/visualization.
- Add a sentiment analysis story: 2 positive reviews and 2 negative reviews examples.
- Ditch the common tools in my slides.
- Do a better job presenting the problem and solution straight away.
- Do a precision-recall and obtain F1 score; area under curve plot.
- Be clear: don't say, "operating" or "dead;" say, "likely to remain in operation" and "not likely to remain in operation."
- List features.

Quick things:
- Be as done as possible by Monday morning.

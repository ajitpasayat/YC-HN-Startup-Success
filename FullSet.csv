5,GazeHawk,GazeHawk (YC S10) Does Eyetracking With Web Cams,146,"About 2 years ago an acquaintance of mine suddenly had a stroke. When she came to she was conscious but completely paralyzed. The only way could communicate was with her eyes [1].<p>She's since recovered and is able to talk. But she describes an intense loneliness and frustration at being a prisoner in her own body. When she was finally able to use an expensive, specialized computer to communicate by slightly moving her fingers, it was an amazing encouragement.<p>Part of the problem right now is that these input systems are extremely expensive and specialized. Even if the family can afford to pay for one, they still have to spend time researching which system is the best.<p>I imagine a free, open-source system that will allow for rapid eyetracking-based writing.

31,chute,Chute (YC W12) Launches A Twilio For Photos,159,"IPIX was a photo-hosting service for E-Bay and various other sites in the late '90's -- that was a very big chunk of their revenue, I believe, and sounds a lot like Chute's product area as well.<p>It looks like E-Bay discontinued the IPIX integration and brought all that in-house, effectively killing IPIX's main cash cow (which was already anaemic after the dot-com crash).  See this article from 2003:  <a href=""http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y03/m09/i22/s01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y03/m09/i22/s01</a> .  I wish the YC company best of luck in addressing this similar market.<p>I think IPIX' original product idea was a special camera to take 360-radial or 360-spherical photos and let people host those images on their website.  Web clients needed a special plugin to view the results.  Using these became popular on various real-estate websites for a while.  It looks from IPIX website (<a href=""http://www.ipix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipix.com/</a>) that that's their main focus again.<p>A former IPIX employee, Adam Sah, took some rudimentary log-aggregation tech he built for monitoring the IPIX servers, got permission to start a new company, and founded Addamark, now SenSage (<a href=""http://www.sensage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sensage.com</a>).  They implemented one of the first columnar databases to minimize large-scale log aggregation storage space (logs take 2.5% the space required in a traditional DB) and to speed up queries.

71,CircuitLab,CircuitLab (YC W13) Has 70K Users/Month For Its Electronics Design Tool,83,"This looks pretty similar to when I tried it a few months ago. I used it once, and never used it again (not saying because it's bad or anything, but I like my tried and true Eagle to do circuit board layout, and I generally don't do analog so I don't really need simulation).<p>I think some things are really nice, but some things are obviously lacking.<p>It's very easy to use. This is great, it's not intimidating (at least for me). I'd like to see copy pasting elements not paste them directly over the other element, and I'd like it to paste it into 'my hand' where I can move it somewhere else right away.<p>Add some color. Try it. This interface is very, very bland. What is there, three colors on the screen? If you're shooting for beginners, adding colors will make a world of a difference. Color the wires. Things connected to V+ are red,  things to GND are black. Signals (wires connected to transistors, etc) are yellow, or whatever. Let me pick the color of LEDs (start them blue or something). Let me tell you what color wires I have on hand, and you make the 'best' decision (or most standard) for laying my circuit out. Colors are one of the best way of rapidly signalling information, use it to your advantage.<p>Automatically connect close components. Say I have 1-2 grid steps in between components, just connect them for me. I wish I could tell you how many times I've hooked a transistor up to a resistor up to an LED in a schematic program. Save some time and just connect it. Luckily, signals generally go left to right, and power goes up and down. This could work nicely.<p>I really, really like how I can hop on and try it right away without signing up for anything. I'll never try Upverter (someone else mentioned it) because I have to sign up before I can even use the damn thing. Maybe it's awesome, maybe it's not, I'll never know. I do know about your product though - and the next time you make changes I'll know I can try it out without being hassled. Fantastic decision.<p>I'm not sure who exactly you guys are targeting - but if you'd like to include beginners, it would be a nice touch to be able to double click components (this operation currently just selects and deselects a component) and get a 'summary' of what the part does. Have a real world picture of them, or embed a wikipedia page, or open a new tab to the wikipedia page, something to more strongly couple the learning aspects to the simulation.<p>It would be nice if I could open up a series of schematics, and poke around with them. The simulation feature is your best learning tool, but if I can't design something yet, I can't really simulate anything. Giving me something like an LED connected to a switch, an 555 LED flasher, and an LED connected to a PWM controlled off a pot. Or something.

117,Amulyte,Amulyte (YC S13) is Building a Better Lifeline For Seniors on the Move,74,"I'm super-impressed and really happy to see this recent batch of YC companies tackling some very underserved and unsexy problems.<p>While Amulyte is not a new idea, I do think their product is a much-needed improvement on what's existed for some time. But will that improvement be enough for it to be a widely adopted product? I don't think so. Products offering similar solutions have been around with moderate levels of success, and neither seniors nor their caretakers are technologically savvy enough to see an accelerometer or self-quantification as selling points. And while selling to nursing homes might seem a good idea, they're already relatively well-monitored settings that account for only 20% of deaths due to falls in people ages 65yo+ [0].<p>I think this is mostly a marketing issue, and an interesting one. This is a morbid product. Buying it acknowledges to some degree that you're old, and on your way out. It's not like life insurance where you buy it once and don't think about it. Nor is it like taking medications that are <i>contributing</i> to your health. A product like this serves as a constant reminder of your fragility while not providing any immediately obvious benefit. Imagine putting it around your neck every day. Beyond the inherent psychological barriers that a product of this nature can create, marketing for this type of solution just hasn't seemed to help. Life Alert, a wear-around-your-neck monitor for the elderly that's been around for a long time, has been known for its ""I've fallen and I can't get up!"" campaign [1]. What elderly person or caregiver would ever want to relate to someone in that commercial?<p>I don't know what the answer to that problem is yet. How do you get people to acknowledge the eventual death of their beloved elderly and push them to be proactive in taking preventative measures without using scare tactics? I'm not sure, but coincidentally, I finally got to reading the article <i>Slow Ideas</i> by Atul Gawande [2] this morning that touches on similar problems -- problems that are insidious and have no immediate solution. He seems to strengthen PG's points on doing things that don't scale [3]. In particular, he talks about how marketing efforts, efforts that scaled, in India to combat cholera were unsuccessful, and how opting for the door-to-door method resulted in significant drops in mortality. The message of the article was that these problems require more than just slick ads and pamphlets. They require changing the norms, changing the way people perceive these problems. And from his experience, the most efficient and successful way of doing that is to do things that do not scale. Maybe that's the answer.<p>A product like this isn't just a shiny new toy someone orders from Amazon, or backs on Kickstarter. This touches on some very deep problems in our society and its views on preventative health, mostly that we don't take it seriously. I think a company like Amulyte should really focus its efforts on creating an effective marketing strategy. They may have the most advanced monitor in the world, but that won't tear down many of the barriers that exist for this type of product. And if they can crack that marketing problem, then there's a lot more success out there to be had. Some food for thought, Amulyte guys. Good luck! I'll definitely be watching closely.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/nursing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/nursing.h...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQlpDiXPZHQ</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/07/29/130729fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/07/29/130729fa_fact_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/ds.html</a>",0.744186046512,10,Operating,Amulyte is an activity tracking and emergency response system that allows seniors to maintain their freedom and independence.,2013,Summer,255000.0,Mountain View,"http://a5.images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1397187134/3b469295aa5c306f86c0c2c448ef8fbe.png",http://www.seed-db.com/companies/view?companyid=2351009,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amulyte,http://www.amulyte.com,Miles Beckett,Matt Tse,Y Combinator,,Jaclyn Konzelmann,Perry Haldenby,,,Health Care,,,,,Operating

149,Clustrix,"Clustrix, a distributed SQL DB, launches on AWS",109,"1) Both joins and aggregates are processed in parallel. In short, the larger your cluster, the faster we evaluate a complex query because we can bring more hardware to the problem.<p>You can get a better idea of how we scale distributed joins from one of my blog posts:<p><a href=""http://www.clustrix.com/blog/bid/242790/Scaling-Distributed-Joins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clustrix.com/blog/bid/242790/Scaling-Distributed-...</a><p>Once we complete the join, we will also perform the aggregate SUM operation across multiple nodes, getting individual sums, and then forwarding the results to another node for a final tally.<p>As a rule of thumb, each node has the throughput of about 70% of MySQL on the same hardware. So if you have a complex query that can take advantage of the cluster (100k rows per table examined qualifies), then you will see a 10x speedup on a 16 node cluster over a single instance.<p>However, that assumes that your entire data set fits in cache on the single instance box. As soon as that's no longer true, it's more likely that you will see a 100x or more speedup from Clustrix because you will have way more memory available for the buffer cache.<p>For example, if you have a 32GB single instance MySQL server, but you have more than 64GB of working set size, you're going to be limited by IO.<p>On Clustrix, if you move this to say a 4 node cluster, you are going to have an effective cache footprint of 128GB. So Clustrix will operate entirely out of cache.<p>2) We're fully ACID compliant using a two phase commit w/ PAXOS for transaction resolution. Because we're MVCC, readers never have to take out locks. To coordinate WRITE access to the same data, we have a row level distributed lock manager. That means that the entire cluster participates in lock management.<p>So yes, this has a higher communication overhead over a single server. If you have a small write workload with very little concurrency, you will see better query latencies from a single instance database.<p>However, as soon as you start getting to more serious write workloads with higher concurrency, Clustrix will distribute your writes across several machines in the cluster. We can handle an aggregate write throughput you can't touch with a single instance database, even with a fancy/expensive storage array.<p>One of our customers, for example, has a peak throughput of 70,000 transactions/sec. They're about 90/10 read/write, so that breaks down to 10,000 TPS for writes. And they are really fond of multi-row updates, insert .. ignore, insert .. on dup update kind of queries. So it's not exactly a lightweight key-value application. Prior to Clustrix, their MySQL installation peaked out at 5,500 TPS total (read+write). They now have a 15 node Clustrix cluster.<p>It's true, you can always construct a workload that will not distribute well.

158,YouGotListings,YouGotListings (YC W11) looks to provide the best tools for real estate,96,"I come from Australia, have lived in the UK, Germany and Switzerland and now live in the US.<p>What I find really interesting is just how badly real estate works online in the US. To quote Bart Simpson, it achieves what was previously thought physically impossible: it sucks and blows at the same time.<p>In Australia there are basically two online sites for both rentals and sales: realestate.com.au and domain.com. They have a lot of crossover and you could honestly find somewhere to live or buy just by looking at one. Estate agents have their own sites too but I really don't know why. Anything they post gets cross-posted to one of these two sites.<p>In the UK, it's basically the same story with findaproperty.co.uk and 1-2 others I'm now forgetting.<p>In Switzerland it's even more centralized where you will find everything on homegate.ch.<p>In the US? It's a disaster. There are so many sites and nothing centralized has really taken off. Even when you boil it down to one city.<p>As a buyer or renter I want to go to a handful of sites and find up-to-date listings. Ideally I'd like that site to tell me how to contact the agent, when the open house is (if there is one), the location (even if only down to cross-street) and photos of the property. Oh and the date it was listed (which should be specified by the site, not the person writing the listing).<p>Online real estate in the US reminds me a lot of recruitment in the UK (both are fragmented disasters).<p>Typically sites will charge for a listing and that listing will stay there until whoever posted it removes it. It's important to have the right incentives here. Charge the advertiser by the amount of time it's shown so brokers and agents don't keep up listings to act like honeypots (much like UK recruiters do with jobs, both fake and real).<p>I feel that some government regulation is required here to stamp down on the misrepresentation that is both possible and actual (in both markets).<p>Even the fact that brokers exist is a sign of market inefficiency. Why do I need an intermediary to find an apartment? In NYC (where I now live) using a broker is almost a must (if you want a non-crappy apartment, which is taking money out of the pocket of the renter and the landlord, in the form of a below market rent). In Manhattan these brokers typically charge 15% (of the annual rent). In Brooklyn and Queens it could well be 1 month or lease.<p>So when I see software that helps brokers and landlords find each other, I see a business model that is perpetuation a market efficiency that I believe is ultimately doomed.<p>Also, $50/month for 1 user but $100/month for unlimited? Big mistake. I seriously suggest you read Joel [1] on this one:<p>> Bad Idea #1: Site Licenses.<p>> The opposite of segmentation, really. I have certain competitors that do this: they charge small customers per-user but then there's a ""unlimited"" license at a fixed price. This is nutty, because you're giving the biggest price break precisely to the largest customers, the ones who would be willing to pay you the most money.

196,280 North,New Product From 280North: Atlas,192,"These guys are awesome and I feel kind of bad to say this, but it's the perferction of a failed idea. I've been trying these kinds of GUI builders for almost 20 years, starting with VB and PowerBuilder, and I always ended up not actually using them.<p>The usual criticism is that they generate awful code, but that's not necessarily the case. The problem is really that these tools ask you to keep clicking on lots of little sliders and lines and bars and shapes and then click over there in that text box to enter a name and then select this or that from a list or menu, wait until that three pixel graphic changes its shape into a handle so you can drag that line over here, etc, and there's no way to automate this.<p>It's a matter of taste whether you like to do it that way when you create _one_ form, but once you create an application or two or three you have to abstract from the repeating patterns and you can't do that with the GUI builder.<p>GUI builders make you stay on the same level of abstraction forever because they don't have the equivalent of meta programming or even just plain procedural programming.<p>The reason why code built with GUI builders is so awful is not so much that they necessarily generate bad code. It's that developers who can put up with repeating the same clicks and drags on the same level of abstraction for years and years are in the wrong profession and create bad code regardless of the tools.<p>Programming is all about abstracting and automating stuff. The pinnacle of GUI builder based abstraction is what Microsoft calls ""user controls"". All they abstract is a bunch of widgets statically glued together on a panel. Great, but that's like 5% of what you want to do.<p>I'm afraid GUI builders are hopeless for any serious programming.",-0.714285714286,45,Operating,280 North is a web software development platform enabling users to build applications through its proprietary tech toolkit Cappuccino.,2008,Winter,250000.0,,"http://a2.images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1397184744/b1eac872f868cc0e1b9f556c5c5a84e0.png",http://www.seed-db.com/companies/view?companyid=94012,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/280-north,http://280north.com,XGYC,Paul Buchheit,Lowercase Capital,Y Combinator,Francisco Tolmasky,Ross Boucher,Tom Robinson,,Presentations Software,,,,,Operating

All cryptographic keys used in the operation of the service have been zerofilled, and while no logs were produced (by design) during operation of the service, all records created incidental to the operation of the service have been deleted to the best of our ability.<p>Essentially, the service was created and operated under a certain understanding of current US law, and that understanding may not currently be valid.  As we are a US company and comply fully with US law, but wish to protect the privacy of our users, it is impossible for us to continue offering the CryptoSeal Privacy consumer VPN product.<p>Specifically, the Lavabit case, with filings released by Kevin Poulsen of Wired.com (<a href=""https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801182-redacted-pleadings-exhibits-1-23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801182-redacted-plea...</a>) reveals a Government theory that if a pen register order is made on a provider, and the provider's systems do not readily facilitate full monitoring of pen register information and delivery to the Government in realtime, the Government can compel production of cryptographic keys via a warrant to support a government-provided pen trap device.  Our system does not support recording any of the information commonly requested in a pen register order, and it would be technically infeasible for us to add this in a prompt manner.  The consequence, being forced to turn over cryptographic keys to our entire system on the strength of a pen register order, is unreasonable in our opinion, and likely unconstitutional, but until this matter is settled, we are unable to proceed with our service.<p>We encourage anyone interested in this issue to support Ladar Levison and Lavabit in their ongoing legal battle.  Donations can be made at <a href=""https://rally.org/lavabit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rally.org/lavabit</a>  We believe Lavabit is an excellent test case for this issue.<p>We are actively investigating alternative technical ways to provide a consumer privacy VPN service in the future, in compliance with the law (even the Government's current interpretation of pen register orders and compelled key disclosure) without compromising user privacy, but do not have an estimated release date at this time.<p>To our affected users: we are sincerely sorry for any inconvenience.  For any users with positive account balances at the time of this action, we will provide 1 year subscriptions to a non-US VPN service of mutual selection, as well as a refund of your service balance, and free service for 1 year if/when we relaunch a

Thank you for your support, and we hope this will ease the inconvenience of our service terminating.<p>For anyone operating a VPN, mail, or other communications provider in the US, we believe it would be prudent to evaluate whether a pen register order could be used to compel you to divulge SSL keys protecting message contents, and if so, to take appropriate action.""",0.967741935484,36,Dead,VPN as a service,2011,Summer,280000.0,,"http://a2.images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1397195000/c5c8af9a3077a23646d6624921351df8.jpg",http://www.seed-db.com/companies/view?companyid=102027,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cryptoseal,http://www.cryptoseal.com,Y Combinator,,,,Erik Berls,Ryan Lackey,Tom Sparks,,Virtualization,Networking,Trusted Networks,Security,,Dead

I want to be able to bust open my favorite text editor and update stuff on-the-fly when I need to.<p>3) Just getting off of a project that involved heavy use of CSS animations, transitions and transforms, I can honestly say they're not that hard -- _especially_ to achieve the effects they show in their demos.<p>4) The types of websites they're promoting as good use cases are the types of sites we all used to be annoyed by when they were created in Flash. Not that this tool forces anyone to create crappy websites, it does enable it though. No splash screens plz.<p>IMHO, CSS is not meant for keyframe animations. It's not.

299,Ididwork,Ididwork (YC Summer 08) Launches,76,"""Micromanagement"" and ""Time Poor"" - 2 concerns that scream out when I look at this product.
RescueTime did a fantastic job at removing the ""time poor"" component for keeping track of where you spend your time, hence living up to its name.<p>Having worked in the corporate world and in start-ups I can tell you now that most corporate clients already have a time sheet system that is a pain in the a<i></i>. Employees spend at least 30mins or so a day writing everything they did throughout the day and billing their time where appropriate.<p>When it comes to getting management feedback for each task you did, again managers are time poor having to deal with more then 1 person in their team + their own tasks from higher management. Hence why performance reviews between you and manager occur every quarter / 6 months / annually and only focus on the high level picture - the stuff that counts - the outcomes / results.<p>Micromanagement is another issue; no one likes to jot down every action they did. What ""matters"" is always the end result not the bits in the middle. I.e. taking a client for coffee spending 2 hours out of the office is a step to a potential sale (building rapport). At the end of the day, the sale is what will count on your performance agreement not the coffee break. My manager doesn't want to know that I went to coffee with a client unless I managed to get a sale.<p>I'm sure some of you would have heard this before but the best workers are those where management give them what they need to do their job and let them do it without micromanaging their time. How and when they do it doesn't matter, all that matters is the end results (outcomes).",0.545454545455,17,Dead,ididwork is an online tool enabling employees to keep track of the work they do over time.,2008,Summer,0.0,,"http://a1.images.crunchbase.com/image/upload/c_pad,h_98,w_98/v1397191209/2d112d40b98019ceaa12225e82a90937.png",http://www.seed-db.com/companies/view?companyid=91021,http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ididwork,http://www.ididwork.com,Y Combinator,,,,,,,,Employment,Curated Web,,,,Dead

339,Memamp,Exploring memcmp,16,"I, and my data, disagree. Most memcmp() calls look at a single byte and return.<p>Let us consider five test cases:<p>memcmp0 - Calling memcmp() at each byte in the file looking ofr a match, as the original article.<p>memcmp1 - As above, but optimize by checking the first character and only calling if it matches.<p>memmem0 - A single call to the glibc memmem() function. Not portable.<p>kmp0 - The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm as implemented at ""Exact String Matching Algorithms"", <a href=""http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/index.html</a><p>bm0 - The Boyer Moore algorithm, also from above<p>Looking for a 1k needle which lies at the end of a 100MB haystack of random bytes, with the data in file system buffers on a 1.6GHz Atom processor running Linux 2.6.29:<p><pre><code>  algorithm  milliseconds\n    memcmp0      2400     ==================================\n    memcmp1       530     ========\n    memmem0       460     =======\n    kmp0          970     ==============\n    bm0            70     = \n</code></pre>\nOn the whole codesink1 wins with the Boyer Moore suggestion. In broader terms, algorithm selection beats optimization and all is right with the CS universe. (KMP's poor showing surprises me, but I've not used it before and don't know what to expect.)<p>If we assume the data is out on a hard drive, then we get these numbers (same machine, a WD Green Power HD which is an evil thing to benchmark with because it has variable spindle and seek speeds, but suffice it to say it is not terribly fast). All OS caches flushed before each test.<p><pre><code>  algorithm  milliseconds\n    memcmp0      3500     ===================================\n    memcmp1      1300     =============\n    memmem0      1200     ============\n    kmp0         1700     =================\n    bm0          1100     =========== \n</code></pre>\nHere disk read time sets a lower bound, algorithm is still important, but not so much as before. I have a sneaky suspicion that mmap() is a poor choice here. There doesn't seem to be much overlap between the IO and compute when looking at the memcmp0 times.<p>Testing on a beefier machine, with a Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz, OS X gives this:<p><pre><code>  algorithm  milliseconds\n    memcmp0      1100     =========================\n    memcmp1       180     ====\n    memmem0       not portable\n    kmp0          360     ========\n    bm0            88     == \n</code></pre>\nThe processor is several times faster, but bringing pages in from the OS is slightly slower. I don't know how to flush OS buffers on this machine so I can't do the disk reading tests.<p>Update: well crap. this fell of the front page before I finished testing. No one will see these results, but I enjoyed the tests anyway.

They play, but it's just not how my servers ran. I paid for it, and a few others who understood what I did and what it cost, would help as well.<p>But 90-95% of my players were not paying members. They were great people and I loved having them on my server. I wouldn't kick them or demand they pay in an instant. But they weren't paying players. They were casual players, friends and friends of friends.<p>This model forces all of your friends to pay, instead of just a few.<p>If I sent this server to my friends, and they found out they had to sign up to play (or only get 10 hours free a month), they likely wouldn't make my server their home. They might come and play, but they won't make it their home. They're not paying players.<p>I wish these guys luck and the best but I will tell you right now, most servers don't have an everyone-pays system. Even the big servers and themed servers, the 100+ servers, most of them have rewards and incentives for paying, but few require payment up front.<p>This seems to fly in the face of the realities of this industry. I wish them the best but I imagine that this is going to be a constant source of background issues until they open up an option to let one person subsidize the cost of a single game world so there can be free players (unlimited hours) on it.<p>EDIT: No bukkit support?

After all, we only ever (at the moment) handle exceptions for you, and so there is curiosity. Is it really necessary, my customer will ask. He considers, perhaps, that the proxy is some clever ploy, a small glimpse at our plans for world domination. A lovely thought, if only it were so. Developers in particular have a tendency to believe that what Proxino does can be done dynamically. They are mistaken.<p>In a general sense, what Proxino does is a form of global exception handling, a way to catch every exception that occurs within your Javascript. To their credit, our customers correctly suspect that some approximation of this can be achieved dynamically. For it certainly can. Here is a naive first pass attempt at such a global handler, no proxy required:<p>window.onerror = function(e){ console.log(e) }<p>Unfortunately, window.onerror does not work in every browser, nor on every piece of code. It will fail to catch some exceptions raised by elements of jQuery, and other similarly complex libraries. Its a simple one-liner, and it sort of works. But quite often, sort of is not enough.<p>With a bit more care  and a lot more code  a clever programmer can find dynamic work arounds for most browsers and most popular libraries. However in the general case, a global exception handler constructed dynamically is something of an elusive, asymptotic state. You are simply not going to get there. And this brings me to my point. Proxino is not interested in most. We want to catch, and tell you about, everything that goes wrong in your Javascript. Enter the proxy.<p>When a request reaches proxy.proxino.com, we lookup your existing code, parse it into AST form, and walk down the tree inserting special try/catch blocks within each function definition, as well as around the file itself. We then serve this instrumented file to your users, and handle every exception that occurs. Naturally, we have optimized this process for speed (with caching, etc.) but this guarantees us  and more importantly, you  complete code coverage. You will know about every exception.<p>Dynamic approaches are incredibly convenient in some ways, but in the general case they simply dont work. And so there is a Good reason for the proxy.

400,SimpleLegal,SimpleLegal (YC S13) Reduces Legal Bills With Machine Learning,132,"Many may be unfamiliar with how legal billing practices have evolved over the past years in the U.S. At the risk of boring people, I'll try to sum it up as I understand it. It does have some interesting aspects.<p>In the days when law was more a ""profession"" than a business, blue-chip clients would pay the bills of blue-chip firms based on, e.g., a $50K invoice that said ""For services rendered."" In a typical case, no further explanation given and none requested. This probably was a vestige of the ""old boy's network"" by which top lawyers and top executives came from a similar elite pedigree and it was regarded as undignified to question professionals about the mysteries of how they worked their craft. (This goes back before my time but I have it on good authority from senior partners with whom I worked circa 1980 in prestige firms).<p>That represented billing at the elite level of law. In the mundane, everyday practice of law, the common practice in billing was indeed that of fixed-fee services. In pre-Silicon Valley days of Santa Clara County in the 1950s, for example, sole practitioners would bill for basic services based on a fee schedule put out by the local bar association (e.g., ""Preparation of will - $400""). Those were the days when local bar associations held much more sway than they do today and, in order to practice, a local lawyer had to do such things as sign up to represent criminal defendants in murder cases as part of an obligatory process (these were the days before the Supreme Court rulings made the right to counsel in capital cases a much more involved process than it is was back then). In any case, it was the courts that caused time-based billing to be foisted on clients as a matter of routine when they struck down the local bar fee schedules as illegal price-fixing.<p>The pattern above is pretty evident: in all cases, lawyers as professionals were seen as part of a closed network by which they themselves set the rules that everyone else simply had to accept. In billing, that meant that lawyers billed as they deemed fit without much scrutiny and without much explanation.<p>The scale of law was also very different then: back in that day, a prestige law firm in San Francisco, for instance, might have 20 to 25 lawyers at the most. The work it did was sophisticated but a typical high-end practice might have included heavy doses of such things as personal injury, maritime practice, construction, and the like in addition to sophisticated commercial and contract work.<p>As litigation exploded in the 1960s and 1970s, as law came to fill social needs previously not considered within its province (e.g., non-discrimination laws), and as mechanisms were adopted to promote large-scale legal actions (e.g., class actions), law morphed from having been primarily a ""profession"" to being primarily a business. The McCutchen (now Bingham) firm that I worked for in the early 80s had about 250 lawyers then and was considered elite. In 1965, it has 20 lawyers, a level to which it had grown from its formation in the 1880s. Today, it has well over 1,000 lawyers and is part of a conglomerate firm with branches in many cities throughout the world. Along with this growth came the rise of hourly billing practices that were typically ""aggressive."" Demand was such that large companies sopped up the services and paid dearly for the privilege: high rates, team-based billing practices with multiple attorneys and paralegals typically staffing a matter while each billing every minute of all their interactions with one another in meetings, chats, intra-office communications, etc.<p>In the beginning, as this explosion in growth occurred, clients were reticent to question the resultant high billings. By the mid-1980s, however, the remnants of the old-style ""profession"" were rapidly fading and law was a big business. Firms such as Finley Kumble were suddenly formed out of nothing by defecting big-firm partners who saw large and fast profits as the primary goal of their business and the billing practices quickly became abusive (Finley became a poster child for this sort of thing and fell apart owing to client revulsion at such abuses).<p>Thereafter, large companies began to question billings much more closely. The rise of in-house lawyers was in part a reaction to the high cost of outside services but, in time, those lawyers were also used routinely to ""manage"" the outside firms by keeping their billings in line, among other things. After a while, as the go-go years of the 1980s and 1990s culminated eventually in the tech bubble of 2000, a funny pattern emerged by which a big-firm billing was almost in the nature of an ""opening offer."" It would routinely come in very high, the in-house people would demand it be reduced, and, after some back-and-forth, ""adjustments"" would be made and it would be paid.<p>The pattern lasted until the bust of 2008 and 2009, which bust sent the big firms reeling and has caused a further re-evaluation of billing practices. The reason for the further change was simply one of supply and demand. Pre-bust, no matter what the abuses, the law firms held ultimate sway because even the largest companies with the most sophisticated in-house staffs would be wary of switching firms easily or of wanting to alienate their main outside firms in any way. That changed with the bust. Suddenly, the large firms looked bloated, overstaffed, and inefficient. And clients, who came to hold the leverage, used it to demand billing concessions: lower rates, caps, fixed-fee arrangements, discounts, and the like. And the law firms had to adjust.<p>In the meantime, quite apart from the big firms, technology has changed law firm billing practices generally. Owing to the widespread availability of information today, clients are much more savvy about how legal billing works and are not hesitant to ask for arrangements that make sense for the client even while being fair to the lawyers providing the services. Thus, scrutiny of legal billing is taken as a given and we have indeed come around 180 degrees from where it all used to be.<p>What SimpleLegal is doing is thus very timely and interesting. Honest and fair billing should be the goal of both lawyers and clients and this seems like an excellent model for helping to promote this.

403,SlapVid,YC startup Slapvid does P2P video from a browser,17,"Personally I don't think that P2P video from a browser is probably the best utilization of this technology. Someone mentioned that even the top videos on Youtube only have 4-5 concurrent users. That alone generates a lot of difficulty for that approach. I supppose that the distribution of traffic on Youtube will have a rather fat long tail. Also from a user's point of view for this approach to work it would require storing not only one video but many. I don't see the point of using my diskspace and my bandwidth for Youtube. That's different for Joost. They get users to download, install, and share the bandwidth as they have more valuable less fat tail content to offer. What's more if you are watching fullscreen you probably won't mind that Joost is making use of your upstream. However if you interpret P2P in the browser as a potential Web cache, and don't restrict yourself to the video approach there are lots of interesting things one could do. You just have to look out for Power-Law shaped traffic around big chunks of data. Maybe internet radio with high quality streams where you could time-shift streams to make optimal usage of the P2P approach. Or the distribution of software. Once you have several millon users using your applet or whatever, you could become the next akamai. To get there one probably would have to go to those guys where bandwidth really hurts. Thinking of sites like the underdogs.com, shareware distributing sites, web radio, etc ... . If you can make them happy by potentially saving bandwidth, and the users are happier by potentially increasing download speed, you might get those guys to ask user's on their web sites to download your little thingy. I think there is room for a P2P based web cache, probably not in distributing Youtube like videos. Perfecting the P2P part, and being able to aquire a sufficient install base, a lot of opportunities might arise.

It takes longer to manufacture them and to send them.<p>""Establish a community of followers.""<p>This is incredibly convoluted. ""Establish"" is too elaborate a word to use here, the user isn't getting a ""community"" of followers - Snipd is - and in general, this does not set the mood in a very pleasing way.<p>EDIT: using Snipd right now. I don't see how to snip things. I get the green window up top, and a bunch of links, and a chance to tag things and make them private - totally unnecessary images, by the way, neither one helps me at all - and there is <i>nothing</i> that either lets me save my snip or get a link to it.<p>EDIT TWO: Okay, so I can't just click it to save a link. That's inconvenient. Threw me off a bit. You also made me lose what I was writing: that's a shame. When I highlight, the fact that I have to click once more to open the menu and then click snip is yet another annoyance. This is not a streamlined process for me, even if I have Snip It attacked to a keyboard shortcut.<p>EDIT THREE: Tumblr's bookmarklet will let me highlight BEFORE I hit the bookmarklet. You should do that too.<p>Your opening webpage is ugly. The highlighted part? Not necessary. The Snip It bookmarklet's font looks off compared to everything else. The coloring scheme is ugly. And cramming three lines of links at the bottom is ugly, too.<p>EDIT FOUR: Why is the bar green? The aesthetic of the rest of your site is brown and non-jarring.

Frankly, I'd take Posterous over this in an instant: easier to register with, and click-and-drag-to-email-client works beautifully. I could even make Automator do it automatically.

there should be more visual demaraction for each question. The exam is a list of questions. Make that visible in the hierarchy. One approach would be to have a list of the questions on the left (like a table of contents) and move 
all the question authoring stuff out of there. Maybe you could have the authoring toolbar that appears on the right of the question currently being edited.

429,The Dating Ring,Paul Graham Isn't Keeping Women out of Tech,77,"Paul Graham isn't keeping women out of technology. Nor do I believe he wants to. If anything, his interests would be served by there being more women in technology, and thus more candidates for YC.<p>Also, Valleywag is a cesspool. I ponied up for the whole interview at The Information. I'd rather eat a bug than talk about what a Gawker publication has to say.<p>But Paul Graham has said some things on this issue that I think are dumb. Moreover, I believe he spends a lot of time worrying about the ways things he says are misconstrued. Reputation is potential energy, as he (correctly) likes to say, and I think he's aware of how much energy is tied up in what he says. Knowing that he is speaking carefully on these issues does not make what he is saying easier to take.<p>It is one thing to suggest that we should correct biases and imbalances as early as we can, because the sooner someone gets started hacking, the sooner they'll be able to bring those skills to bear on the market. Sure, that's true and probably benign.<p>It is another thing entirely to suggest that special status is conferred on people who started hacking when they were 13, and that it might be ""too late"" for people who didn't to join the ranks of that elite.<p>It is one thing to suggest that there are people that have, for whatever reason (nature or nurture) a natural affinity to working with computer programs and technology. True. Benign.<p>It is another thing to project backwards from that the idea that if women were going to be good at coding, ""they would have found it on their own"". That's not true. It presumes that the most important factor in determining whether someone's going to be a good coder is that they have the affinity. But you need more than affinity: you need opportunity and support.<p>A gigantic blind spot men in technology have is that there are two sides to the problem of gender bias. The side of the coin everyone thinks about is prejudice and bias. Men hear about gender imbalance in technology and interrogate their conscience. ""Do I think women are inherently less qualified then men? No! I've never made a decision based on that belief!"" They're probably even right about that.<p>The coin has another side: privilege. Privilege is a simple concept. Certain kinds of people ""fit the mold"". Paul Graham knows what the typical successful startup hacker looks like. So do most people who work at technology companies. If you ask someone in our field at random to visualize an elite startup hacker and then take bets on the attributes of that imaginary person, you would be nuts to bet on anything but ""male"", ""English-speaking"", ""20-40"", and ""white or Asian"".<p>25-year-old English-speaking white males have a privilege, whether they like it or not, because they fit into everyone's mold of a startup hacker. They will sometimes be asked stupid, discouraging questions at job interviews. Like, ""do you have any children, and, if so, how will you balance the work of taking care of them with the demanding schedule of this job?"". Or, ""when did you start coding? We're really looking not so much for someone who can execute this role, but rather who <i>lives and breathes</i> technology"".

434,Thread,ASK PG/HN: Questions before interview for S11 batch,15,"1. Since we show you all the paperwork in advance, the only thing you don't know before I call is how much stock we'll ask for.  Usually groups can decide about that on the fly, or even in advance.  So most people either tell me yes or no when I call them, or call back a few minutes later.  But we don't have any deadline for replying, so if groups have some reason they need more time to decide, we always give it to them.  E.g. there was once a startup that we offered to fund that got an acquisition offer that weekend.  They needed weeks to see if the acquisition was going to happen.  (It did.)<p>2. It wasn't DST but the Start Fund, which is a separate thing. I believe those guys are going to invest again, but I can't promise anything, because it's not for me to promise.  A lot of people don't realize this, but YC was not a party to that deal.  It was just between Start Fund and the individual startups.  (We were in favor of it, certainly, but we didn't have any agreements with anyone.)<p>3. In years past I caved a few times when people tried to negotiate with me, but I haven't recently.  I realized I was just doing it out of fatigue at the end of a long day of interviews.  I've also learned from experience that there is near zero correlation between groups' tendency to negotiate and how well they end up doing.  In fact come to think of it, possibly an inverse correlation.

There are, however, some out of context quotes and a ridiculous looking picture (the photographer was nice, but quirky). Oh well, I <3 press.<p><i>To clarify:</i><p>-We've never said that we'll never take money. In an ideal situation, startups would not have to take money and if we can get away with it great, if not that's okay. We're well aware that the odds are against us on this one.<p>-We've been very open with this with our potential investors. The sharp money is still investing in this economy and luckily some of them are still interested in us. You think a VC will argue with you when you say you want more months of operational information so you can make a better informed, data-driven decision? Nada. I've talked to four potential investors this week alone.<p>-Due to the economy, sales have stayed relatively flat as average sales have gone down while volume has gone up. However, we're still working out bugs and have over $1 billion worth of tickets on the site. Most people don't even know we have concert tickets yet, which is by design. We'll be chasing more PR soon, which will hopefully lead to real salaries for myself and Tom.<p>-We don't have a model, a deck, a pitch book or executive summary. We'll make them on demand if they are ever needed. If you want to do it right, it's a very time consuming process. In the short term we thought it was a better use of our time to talk to our users (I respond to literally every non-form letter email), create content, develop and sell.<p>-Obviously models can reflect growth rates. My point was: when you are growing quickly in the early stages, by the time you get to the final boardroom meeting, everything can very easily be out of date. This is especially true when you haven't spent any money on advertising.<p>-Month over month traffic is up 67% as of today.

454,Vizera Labs,YC-Backed VizeraLabs Projects New Materials onto Any Surface,62,"This is pretty neat from a technical standpoint.  I've used MadMapper before and it was kind of a pain to setup to use to do projection mapping.<p>First you had to hand map each section of the object you're mapping the texture onto.  This involved having the projector project a pattern and you'd move and deform various mapping polygons (using a mouse) until you didn't have any bleed or holes in the projection.  If someone moved (or more likely accidentally bumped) the projector or the target object the polygons had to be manually adjusted.  It seems these guys have automated the process of mapping the object in physical space, against a pre computed model.  They had some bleed above the top of the chair in their demo video so its not yet perfect.<p>If you're Ikea and can set this up in the store, for buying a couch, and just have people click their fabric combination they want to see. I see this being very useful because they can't show every fabric.

This isn't solving the problem. It's compounding it. Let's say WhereBerry tries to ""solve"" this problem by allowing Julie to invite non-members via email. We tried that, too.

473,Zidisha,How Zidisha (YC W14) Is Misleading the Public About Its Interest Rates,327,"Dear all,<p>I'm the director of Zidisha, and have just posted this response to the blog post. I'd be happy to respond to questions here.<p>Dear Modern Microcredit,<p>I'm sorry that you found our website information misleading.  I'd like to address your points here:<p>1. Interest rate diagram: As we do apply a 5% transaction fee, I agree that the diagram showing a range of 0% to 15% is incorrect.  A volunteer had donated the diagram to us years ago, and we did not scrutinize it sufficiently before using it in our website.  We have now removed the diagram until it can be adjusted to reflect the 5% minimum cost.<p>2. Registration Fee: This is approximately $12 paid when a borrower first joins Zidisha, and provides lifetime membership.  We do not include it in the interest cost calculation because it covers the unlimited number of loans that borrower may receive over the course of many years.<p>3.  Zidisha service fee: This is a flat 5% of the loan amount per year the loan is held.  Most Zidisha loans are held for less than a year, so it is usually less than 5% of the loan amount.  For example, the 5% fee for $50 loan held for three months would be 1.25%, or about 63 cents.  That is hardly exorbitant.<p>4.  Interest offered to lenders: We allow borrowers to offer any interest rate they choose to lenders, from 0% up to a maximum of 25% of the value of the loan per year the loan is held.  In practice, the highest rates are usually offered by first-time borrowers who have not yet established track records with Zidisha (much as new eBay sellers offer the first few items at a discount).<p>5.  Using a collection of randomly selected loans as a proxy for average cost to Zidisha borrowers is misleading.  First-time Zidisha loans are overrepresented in this measure, because they are smaller and repaid more quickly, and are therefore more numerous than the larger subsequent loans taken by established borrowers.  Since first-time loans pay the highest annualized interest (because they are held for a short time), using them as an example overstates the average cost of Zidisha loans.  Our statistics correct for this by using a weighted average based on dollar amounts rather than single loans.<p>6.  We use flat rates not in order to deceive, but simply because they are more intuitive to borrowers and lenders than APR.  The vast majority of our borrowers are used to flat rates being quoted by local lenders, and when they tell us they want to borrow $100 at 10% interest, they mean that they wish to repay $110.  If we wanted to distort our data to appeal to lenders, it would make more sense to use APR, as the higher quoted rates would make lending through Zidisha seem more profitable.  In fact, our intent is simply to make the cost easy to understand for everyone.  For extra clarity, we provide extensive explanation of APR vs. flat rates, and display the exact dollar amounts borrowers pay for each loan in the loan profile pages.  I don't see how this can be construed as hiding information. Using APR in Zidisha's situation would mean sacrificing a measure that the majority of our members understand easily for theoretical precision.<p>7.  You imply that Zidisha does not in fact lower the cost of microloans in developing countries.  That is not true.  Even the $50 loan you cited above, which chose to offer to lenders the maximum interest rate we allow at Zidisha, ended up costing the borrower only $1.73 in interest and fees.  I would be surprised if any other lender would offer an online applicant with no credit history a short-term loan at such rates.<p>Zidisha's cost savings to borrowers have been independently analyzed.  Below is an excerpt from a study published by microfinance analyst Daniel Rozas. (Note that the average interest borrowers have opted to pay lenders has increased from 2-3% at the time of this study to about 5-6% currently, but this does not invalidate the conclusion that Zidisha's rates are substantially lower than what has hitherto been available.)<p>Zidisha’s interest rates are remarkably low, ranging between 7-8% annually (quoted flat), of which 2-3% is charged by lenders and 5% is levied by Zidisha to fund its operations. An additional fee of some $10-20 is charged for initial registration (but not for subsequent loans). This is far below the local prevailing rates – MFTransparency places similarly-sized loans (50,000 KES) at about 35% APR (Zidisha’s loans are 15-18% APR). And it’s all the more noteworthy, considering that Zidisha’s borrowers are largely in rural areas, where credit tends to be more expensive.

476,Amiato,Amiato (YC W12) Launches To Bring Big Data A/B Testing With SQL To All,29,"AB Testing involves (1) changing or deploying a new feature, (2) many times measuring new properties linked with the feature, and then (3) analyzing the resulting user behavior. We help in the analysis process because most tools fall short here.<p>For example, supposed you add more weapons to promote more battles in an online game to keep players engaged. Say, in addition, you start collecting measurements about how long battles take. Suddenly, after introducing the feature, the opposite happens: players leave.<p>Most off-the-shelf AB tools will only tell you whether feature A or feature B worked (the ""what""), but not the ""why."" It could be that battles are taking longer, so players lose interest without finishing. Or, more battles cause players to die/lose more, so they leave.<p>We let you ask questions in SQL that will resolve this and find out why. So, you can fix the problem, rather than be left in the dark. You might introduce a feature to shorten battles, or find a way so players don't die so often.<p>Sophisticated online gaming companies invest in complicated data infrastructure and experts to let you ask those questions (Hadoop, data warehouses, etc.). But, they end up spending days massaging the data --- e.g. to load the new property ""time spent in battle"" -- before you can ask deep questions. In this case, you may get your answer, but its too late -- you've already lost your players.<p>We give you direct access to all your event data (including new properties) immediately through SQL. You can ask the deep questions and resolve ""why"" right away.

478,Nowmov,"Nowmov (YC W10): Sit Back, Relax, And Watch An Endless Stream of Videos",74,"I pursued this idea with randomwalker for about 6 months before realizing there's absolutely no business value here. My advice to Nowmov: choose another market before it's too late. We did, and it's been going much better for us. Fortunately, we didn't come across a strong celebrity endorsement like Ashton Kutcher's, so there was little cost to switching gears.<p>The problem with video recommendations is content ownership. YouTube has a monopoly on user-generated content so they immediately became our number one risk. Our business was henceforth bound to their ToS. Shortly after we switched gears, the Totlol debacle surfaced on Hacker News, confirming our suspicions that the risk was too great for a business to tolerate.<p>The main obstacle with the YouTube ToS is that they don't allow advertising on pages where the video content is the focal point of the page. Nowmov clearly focuses on videos, so the 'get-big-and-strike-it-rich' model is not an option for them. Moving beyond YouTube -- say, using licensed content -- cripples their product, because there simply isn't enough content to create a compelling recommendation engine. Even Hulu, being backed by industry giants, is bleeding content providers.<p>I can't emphasize this enough: this is a cool product, but not a good business. We had cool algorithms that provided fantastic recommendations and kept users on our alpha site for an average of 13 minutes before adding any type of social features. ""Pandora for videos"" was dead simple to pitch, too. I wish NowMov the best of luck and I hope they can succeed where we failed.

481,Virool,Virool (YC S12) Raises $6.62 Million Seed Round To Help Make Videos Go Viral,65,"How do you scale something that decreases in value with every new customer it acquires? You can only pump so many fake video promotions into a market before it's completely saturated and people start to resent the constant assault of your ads. Not to mention the fact that every Tom, Dick and Jane with a camera is already pushing their own videos every chance they get.<p>Then there's this:<p>> All [Jimmy Kimmel] had done was expose [the Double Rainbow] video to a couple hundred million people who would find this video interesting to them, Debelov says. (Actually, [Kimmel] tweeted it to his 90,000 Twitter followers). Weve taken that process, and reversed engineered it. We cant guarantee your video will go viral because it all depends on your content, but we can get it in front of a million, two million, half a million, whatever your budget is  we can get you in front of that audience.<p>You've reverse engineered the power of celebrity? Highly doubtful. When a comedian with the clout of Jimmy Kimmel calls something the ""funniest video in the world""[1], his fans are going to watch that video. When those same people see a video advertisement at the bottom of a blog post or in one of their mobile apps, they're going to ignore it. Hell, even celebrity has its limits -- Kimmel's suggestions would be ignored if he started posting random videos rather than specific links of his own choosing.<p>Anyone born after 1980 has been conditioned since adolescence to ignore online advertisements. It's gotten to the point where you have two choices: 1.) Make your ad so obtrusive that it might actually cost you users, or 2.) Don't infuriate your users, and settle for a CTR of .01% on a good day.

It either requires a lot of smart code rolling up large amounts of data into manageable pieces, or a very big piece of iron that can deal with somewhat raw data. And in either case, everyone has their data in a different format in a different database on a different OS. The result is that you need a behemoth piece of enterprise software or a custom written solution.<p>Even if you build a really smart UI that lets you quickly build reports that slice and dice you data, one dimension is too large to quickly process, or the ID's in another set don't quite line up.
